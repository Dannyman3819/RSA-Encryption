# RSA-Encryption
MAT-243 Final; RSA Encryption using Java
  
  -A different look at RSA encryption with encryting every character separately
  
Fatal flaw where its possible to analyze encypted text to figure out seperate characters and using guessing method to figure out encryted values

Possible fix would be to find a different salt for every character
